Added Member To Class: ClassName=Controller Member=Component E1 Illuminated Rotary Encoder w/ RGB LED and select switch    Encoders rotate similarly to potentiometers, but theyâ€™re different from potentiometers in that an encoder has full rotation without limits. They output gray code so that you can tell how much and in which direction the encoder has been turned.   This encoder includes an RGB LED and a push-down select switch.
